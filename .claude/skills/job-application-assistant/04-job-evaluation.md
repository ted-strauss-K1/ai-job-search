# Job Evaluation Framework

<!-- SETUP: Skill match areas and career goals are personalized by running /setup -->

## Scoring Dimensions

Evaluate each job posting against these five dimensions:

### 1. Technical Skills Match (0-100)
How well do the required/preferred skills align with the candidate's capabilities?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Core requirements are primary skills |
| 60-79 | Most requirements match, 1-2 gaps that are learnable |
| 40-59 | Partial match, significant upskilling needed |
| 0-39 | Fundamental mismatch |

**Strong match areas:** Data governance, research data management (RDM), LMS/Moodle administration and development, LAMP++ web development, learning & development design, metadata standards, devops/SSO/LDAP, open science, bilingual EN/FR
**Moderate match areas:** Python/R/data analysis, cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), AI governance and adoption, project/program management, enterprise platforms
**Weak match areas:** Pure ML/data science, large-scale corporate people management, finance/legal/compliance-only domains, non-web software engineering

### 2. Experience Match (0-100)
Does work history align with what they're looking for?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Direct experience in the same domain and role type |
| 60-79 | Related experience, transferable skills clear |
| 40-59 | Adjacent experience, would need to make the case |
| 0-39 | Unrelated experience |

**Strong:** Research data management, data governance in academic/research settings, LMS administration and Moodle development, open science infrastructure, web application development (LAMP stack), training program design and delivery
**Moderate:** Data governance in enterprise/corporate settings, software developer in non-research domains, technical project management
**Entry-level:** People management at scale (10+ direct reports), formal enterprise architecture roles

### 3. Behavioral/Culture Fit (0-100)
Does the role and company culture match the behavioral profile?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Culture strongly matches behavioral preferences |
| 60-79 | Mixed signals but mostly compatible |
| 40-59 | Some friction areas |
| 0-39 | Significant culture mismatch |

**Red flags to research:** Department disorganization, work dominated by maintenance over development, poor chemistry with leadership, culture mismatches. Check reviews, media coverage, LinkedIn connections, and network contacts for insider perspective.

### 4. Location & Logistics (Pass/Fail + Notes)
- Within commute range: PASS
- Remote with occasional office: PASS
- Requires relocation: FAIL (deal-breaker)
- Frequent international travel: FLAG (discuss with user)

### 5. Career Alignment & Motivation (0-100)
Does this role advance career goals and contain tasks that energize?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Strongly aligned with career direction, clear growth path |
| 60-79 | Good role but only partially aligned with long-term goals |
| 40-59 | Decent job but doesn't build toward career goals |
| 0-39 | Dead end or backwards step |

**Career goals:**
- Data governance specialist, RDM coordinator, or data stewardship manager role in research, government, or regulated enterprise
- Learning ecosystem manager or Moodle platform lead in higher education or edtech
- Open science infrastructure contributor (Digital Research Alliance, university research support)

**Motivation filter:** Evaluate not just whether Ted *can* do the tasks, but whether the tasks will *energize* him. Consider:
- Tasks that energize: storytelling with data, building communities of practice, designing training programs, making complex systems accessible to non-specialists, cross-institutional collaboration
- Tasks that drain: pure compliance enforcement with no human/adoption dimension, isolated individual contributor work with no stakeholder interaction, repetitive maintenance with no creative latitude
- Non-task factors: public mandate or mission-driven culture, degree of autonomy, bilingual environment, distributed/remote team compatibility

**Life situation alignment:** Consider personal constraints:
- **Security**: currently available; motivated by stable role after series of contracts; salary target CAD $75k–$110k
- **Flexibility**: open to hybrid and remote; Montreal-based; no relocation
- **Professional development**: wants roles that grow governance + L&D combination, not just one dimension

### 6. Salary Benchmark (Optional)

If the salary lookup tool is configured (`salary_data.json` exists), look up the company:
```
python salary_lookup.py "<Company Name>" --json
```

If a city is known from the posting, add `--city "<City>"` to narrow results.

Present findings as:
```
### Salary Benchmark
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [Category] index | XX.X (+/-X.X% vs baseline) |
| Overall index | XX.X (+/-X.X% vs baseline) |
```

Interpret results relative to the baseline defined in the data file's metadata. For index-based data, higher typically means above-market compensation.

If the salary tool is not configured, skip this section.

## Output Format

- **Good Fit** (60-74): Apply, address gaps in cover letter
- **Moderate Fit** (45-59): Consider carefully, discuss with user
- **Weak Fit** (30-44): Probably skip unless strategic reasons
- **Poor Fit** (<30): Skip

## Pre-Application: Call the Employer (Best Practice)

Before writing the application, consider whether the candidate should call the contact person listed in the posting. **Only call if there are substantive questions** - never call just to "be remembered."

### When to Suggest Calling
- The posting has unclear or ambiguous requirements
- It's unclear which competencies are essential vs. nice-to-have
- The role description is vague about day-to-day tasks
- There's a named contact person who invites questions

### Good Questions to Ask
- "What are the primary challenges in this role?"
- "How is time typically divided across the listed responsibilities?"
- "Which competencies are most critical for success in this position?"
- "What does success look like in the first 6-12 months?"

### Rules for the Call
- Prepare a 30-second "elevator pitch" about your background in case they ask
- The call's purpose is **gathering information**, not delivering a pitch
- Take notes - use what you learn to tailor the application
- Reference the conversation naturally in the cover letter ("After speaking with [name], I was especially drawn to...")
